# Zero Waste Kitchen Model

**Zero Waste Kitchen Model** is a capstone project aimed at reducing food wastage in university hostels through a combination of hardware and software solutions. The system ensures efficient meal management using biometric-based mess entry and a web-based meal preference system.

## About the Project

This project addresses the significant issue of food wastage in hostel messes, where meals are often prepared for students who don't attend. By integrating a biometric scanner with a web application, students can opt in or out of meals, enabling mess staff to prepare meals based on actual requirements.
